# build_image builds the image and then reads config.yaml *through it*: the
# app inside is the YAML parser, so these scripts get exactly the defaults and
# validation the server uses, and the host needs nothing but Docker -- not
# even Python. That ordering is also why the image name -- which lives in
# config.yaml like everything else -- is applied as a tag after the build
# rather than passed to it.
#
# Afterwards these are set: IMAGE_ID, CONFIG_FILE, SECRET_FILE, VERSION,
# DOCKER_SETTINGS (the assignments below, as text), and every docker_* /
# server_* value printed by `config shell docker` (see
# app/core/config_command.py for the list), including docker_url.
