Wrote ${CONFIG_FILE}
and ${SECRET_FILE} (both mode 0600; secret.key holds a new key).
config.yaml configures the server and the container. Review it before the
first start, in particular:

  server.secure_cookies   true behind HTTPS; false only for plain http://localhost
  server.trust_proxy      true once a reverse proxy you control is in front,
  server.trusted_proxies  with the address it connects from (see config.yaml)
  docker.bind_address     127.0.0.1 keeps it reachable only from this host
  docker.host_port        the port published there

It will be served at ${docker_url}
(from ${docker_url_source}).

Then run docker/run.sh again. Back config/secret.key up: it is the only thing
that can read the database. Most settings can be changed later from the
owner's Settings screen while the container runs.

Ready: ${docker_url}
       (from ${docker_url_source})

Three things on the host make up this deployment:

  ${CONFIG_FILE}
      every setting (mounted writable at ${CONTAINER_CONFIG}; the owner's
      Settings screen saves it in place, keeping the previous version in
      ${DATA_DIR}/config.yaml.bak)
  ${SECRET_FILE}
      the key that encrypts the database (mounted read-only)
  ${DATA_DIR}/
      app.db and storage/ (mounted at /app/data)

Back them up: docker exec ${docker_container} python -m app manage backup
writes one file to ${DATA_DIR}/backups while the server runs, and
docker/restore.sh puts one back. secret.key is not in it, so keep a copy of
that apart from your backups -- the database is useless without it.

Editing config.yaml on the host: most settings apply within seconds. Use an
editor that saves in place (vi, nano, VS Code do); one that writes a new file
and renames it over the old leaves the container looking at the old file --
the Settings screen says so, and restarting the container picks it up.

What the flags above are doing:

  -p ${docker_publish}
                     docker.bind_address:docker.host_port:server.port. This
                     app does NOT terminate TLS -- put nginx/Caddy/Traefik in
                     front and let it hold the certificate.
  --read-only        The container cannot write to its own filesystem. Only
                     the data directory and the tmpfs are writable.
  --cap-drop ALL     No Linux capabilities at all.
  --no-new-privileges  A process in here can never gain more rights than it
                     started with, even via a setuid binary.
  (non-root)         Runs as the image's unprivileged "app" user.
  --pids-limit/--memory/--cpus  Blast radius limits (docker.pids_limit,
                     docker.memory, docker.cpus). Raise them deliberately for
                     real load rather than finding out under traffic.

A new login link for the owner any time, from this checkout:

Day to day, mint further logins from the admin panel in the running app. The
CLI works against the running container -- SQLite lets it open the database
alongside the live server:

  docker exec -it ${docker_container} python -m app manage list-users

If the container is stopped, run a one-off with the same two mounts:

  docker run --rm -v "${DATA_DIR}:/app/data" \\
