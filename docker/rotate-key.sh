#   here           writes the new key to config/secret.key.next
#   a container    moves the data onto it, with the app stopped
#   here           retires secret.key, puts the new key in its place, and
#                  clears the marker
#
# Stopped at any point, running it again finishes the same rotation. Until
# then the server refuses to start, rather than start on a key that does not
# match the data.
